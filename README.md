## Flix Part 1

### User Stories

#### REQUIRED (10pts)
- [x] (10pts) User can view a list of movies (title, poster image, and overview) currently playing in theaters from the Movie Database API.

   - [x] (1pt) In portrait mode, the poster image, title, and movie overview is shown.
   - [x] (1pt) In landscape mode, the rotated alternate layout should use the backdrop image instead and show the title and movie overview to the right of it.

- [x] (2pts) Improved the user interface by experimenting with styling and coloring.
   - [x]    Added Linear Gradient Background through Additional drawable resource file
   - [x]    Added non-scrolling "Now Showing" Heading to top of UI
   - [x]    Changed Text colours and font for better visibility and impact

- [x] (2pts) For popular movies (i.e. a movie voted for more than 5 stars), the full backdrop image is displayed. Otherwise, a poster image, the movie title, and overview is listed. Use Heterogenous RecyclerViews and use different ViewHolder layout files for popular movies and less popular ones.

Heterogeneous RecyclerView - Shows the change in display style for popular and less popular movies.

### Notes
I had the most issues with the heterogenous recycler views as I initially used the the viewholder I defined for teh initial application's onCreate method. This caused errors in casting to a different viewholder type. Apart from that, I had some minor issues fetching and separating data from the Database as I had trouble deciphering teh returned key value pairs and had to go over the results for atleast 30 minutes to undertstand the various components and data values returned and thus debug my code.
